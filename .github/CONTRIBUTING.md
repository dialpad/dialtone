# Contributing

Dialtone exists as a monorepo containing multiple packages. Libraries are stored in the packages folder, and deployable documentation sites are stored in the apps folder. Currently the Dialtone Vue storybook documentation sites are stored in the same folder as their libraries due to a limitation of storybook, however this may change in the future as it makes more logical sense for them to be stored in the apps folder.

Each package has its own contributing guide, please follow the links to find the actual contributing guide you might need.
