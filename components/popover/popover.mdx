# Popovers

<Subtitle>
  Popovers are a generic component that conditionally displays a content overlay in-line with an anchor element.
</Subtitle>

## Basic Usage

Popovers may be used standalone, or to create a dropdown menu or other complex control.
If you want use popover as a component which takes over the whole screen, there's a prop modal for that, or you can use
DtModal. Keep in mind accessibility for popover and modal components are different.

A popover has 2 major pieces that are provided as required named slots: the **anchor** and the **content**.

The **anchor** is the control that the content will be positioned relative to and triggers the visibility of the
content. Normally a button, the anchor can be any *interactive* element that could control the visibility of the popover
content. For example, the anchor could be an input element with a conditionally displayed listbox content element to
implement an auto-suggest form component.

The **content** slot will be rendered lazily when the popover is open. By default, the popover content will
automatically be closed when clicking outside the content or on escape key press, so it is important to use `.sync` on
the `open` prop (or `v-model:open` in Vue 3) so it can be updated if the popover closes itself.

### Import

```jsx
import { DtPopover } from '@dialpad/dialtone-vue';
```

### Basic usage with named slots

```jsx
<dt-popover
  :open.sync="open"
>
  <template #anchor="{ attrs }">
    <dt-button
      v-bind="attrs"
    >
      Click to open
    </dt-button>
  </template>
  <template #content>
    <p>I will be displayed in the popover!</p>
  </template>
</dt-popover>
```

or

```jsx
<dt-popover
  :open="open"
>
  <template #anchor="{ attrs }">
    <dt-button
      v-bind="attrs"
      @click="open = !open"
    >
      Click to open
    </dt-button>
  </template>
  <template #content>
    <p>I will be displayed in the popover!</p>
  </template>
</dt-popover>
```

## Accessibility

Popover, in their current implementation, are accessible when used as interactive components.
Content will be read to screen reader users, and the popover markup by default get appended to the `parent`
(also it could be placed to the end of `<body>` or other DOM element)

There are a few important considerations to ensure popover controls are accessible.
The popover, by default:

- the popover content will have a generic role of "dialog".
- focus will be transferred into the popover to the first content focusable element, and after close, triggering
element will be focused (like in the modal component)

### Anchor

The anchor element that activates the popover should be fully accessible by keyboard. The easiest way to do this is by
using an element like an `DtButton` that is already accessible. The user should also be able to close the popover
content using the `ESC` key for most ARIA roles.

There are some required ARIA attributes for the anchor element (such as `aria-expanded` set based on `open` and
`aria-haspopup` that matches the `role`). To make this as straightforward as possible, these ARIA attributes are passed
with the correct values as the `attrs` slot-scope to the anchor slot. Applying them is as simple as using `v-bind`:

```jsx
<template #anchor="{ attrs }">
  <dt-button v-bind="attrs">I'm accessible now!</dt-button>
</template>
```

By default, the dialog content will be labeled by the entire anchor element. To change this, you can do one of 2 things:

1. Pass `aria-label`, which is the text label that will be applied to the dialog content.
2. Pass `aria-labelledby`, which is an ID of the element that should be used as the descriptive label.

### Keyboard

The popover closes on `ESC` key press.

## Variants

### Dynamic alignment

The popover content supports both fixed and dynamic horizontal and vertical alignment around the anchor element. If
`fixedAlignment`/`fixedVerticalAlignment` are passed, the popover will always be positioned in that direction. If you
omit either of them, the popover will dynamically adjust the corresponding position, trying not to clip the content
relative to the `$root` element. This calculation happens each time the popover is opened or window is resized.

### Flip

The popover uses [headless-tippy](https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/v6/headless-tippy/) and
[popper](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/modifiers/flip/), which has flip modifier (which can change the placement of a
popper when it's scheduled to overflow a given boundary). By default, boundary is `clippingParents`
(corresponding popover prop is `flipBoundary`).

### Padding

Padding options for the popover content are provided via size classes `small`/`medium`/`large` in order to standardize
the look of the popover content between usages. To remove the padding from the content, you can pass `none`:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-popovers--no-padding" />
</Canvas>
