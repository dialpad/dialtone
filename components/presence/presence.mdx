# Presence

<Subtitle>
    This component displays a presence circle indicating the current status.
</Subtitle>

## Base Style

Presence can be initialized by passing `presence` prop that can take one of 4 values: 'away', 'active', 'offline', and 'busy'.
By default, it's set to 'active'.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-presence--default" />
</Canvas>

## Variants

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-presence--variants" />
</Canvas>

## Props, Slots & Events

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />

## Usage

### Import

```jsx
import { DtPresence } from '@dialpad/dialtone-vue';
```

### With Presence Prop

```html
<dt-presence
  presence="active"
/>
```

### With SR text prop

```html
<dt-presence
  presence="active"
  sr-text="User Presence"
/>
```

### With Theme prop

```html
<dt-presence
  theme="default"
/>
```

### Accessibility

The Presence component is purely visual by default, and will not be read out to a screen reader.

If you'd like for a SR to read out any changes to Presence, you should pass the `srText` prop so it is
read by AT and set the `aria-live` attribute to either 'polite' or 'assertive'.
Even though the component has a role of "status" to assist SR apps in reading out status changes, its default
'aria-live' value is set to 'off'.

[See W3C guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/aria/ARIA22)
for more information.

Example:

```html
<dt-presence
  presence="active"
  sr-text="User {{ user }} is active"
/>
```

Abbreviations / symbols should be read out in full for voiceover / screen readers.
