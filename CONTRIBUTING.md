# Contributing

Before contributing a new component to Handset, please check the [Github Project][project] board to see if there is already an issue for it and if not, add it.

## Pull Requests

Changes to the Handset library should ideally be separate from any other changes to other project code. All pull requests should be assigned to the `@dialpad/handset` team and require at least one approval to merge.

## Requirements

Any new components or updates to existing components require at least:

- Unit tests covering the entire change.
- Storybook documentation.
