**ðŸ‘‹ Hey there,** we're excited to share some updates with you:

* We redesigned our [Tokens Page](/tokens) and now you can easily search and copy any token.

* We are rolling out a new component, the [Empty State Component](/components/empty-state.html).

## Redesign of the tokens page

### Now it's easier to find a token

Now you can search for the token you need by name, category or value.
Once you find the token you need, you can click on the copy button to copy it in the selected format.

### Examples for every token

We now added examples for all the tokens to better show what the result of using the token will be.

### Sidebar with categories and subcategories

You can now explore all the tokens available by category and subcategory using the new sidebar on the right.
While you search the categories will be filtered.

### Change theme, format and share the filter

Change theme and format in the topbar. Available formats are: **CSS**, **Android** and **iOS**. Change the theme to see how the token would look both in light and dark mode. Use the "Share filter" button to get a URL with the search and filters applied.

### Hover to see the values for composition tokens

If you are curious about a value inside a composition token, you can hover to reveal it.

## Empty state component

Ever needed to show a "No Results" page? Or an empty call history?

For these a many more scenarios the Empty State Component is now available. You can checkout all the variants and examples in the [Empty State Component Page](/components/empty-state.html).
