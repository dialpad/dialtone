**ðŸ‘‹ Hey there,** we're excited to share some updates.

## Dialtone 9 promoted to latest

Now that all our core apps have been migrated from Dialtone 8 to Dialtone 9.
We are promoting Dialtone 9 to latest.

### How this will affect you?

From now on, you should install Dialtone with `pnpm install @dialpad/dialtone@latest --save-exact`.

### Still not fully migrated?

If you're using our library and haven't fully migrated to Dialtone 9, please refer to this
[blog post](https://dialtone.dialpad.com/about/whats-new/posts/2023-12-28.html) for the migration reference.

## Got questions?

We're here to help! Reach out us in the `#dialtone` channel for any assistance you need.

Thanks for your patience and understanding,
Dialtone Team ðŸ’œ
