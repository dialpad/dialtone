Hi everyone, hope you're having a great holidays. As the year comes to an end, it's time for a big update!.
In this blog post we'll talk about the release of Dialtone 9.

## TLDR; Dialtone 9 released and published with @next tag

We decided to release a mono-package containing all dialtone packages under the name of `@dialpad/dialtone`.

This aligns better with our monorepo approach, helps up to ease the task of maintaining all our packages up-to-date
on clients using dialtone and makes using multiple dialtone packages easier.

In order to do so, we increased the version of `@dialpad/dialtone` as this is a breaking change but released to
@next tag to avoid unintentionally updating clients to this version of dialtone yet.

Also, we're going to continue releasing Dialtone CSS library to `@dialpad/dialtone-css` (formerly dialtone) as a
separate
package in case someone still needs to use it.

As soon as we can start, we're going to do the migration on product to update the dialtone version and migrate
the usage of multiple dialtone packages to the mono-package with its multiple entries.

### How do I update to Dialtone 9

In order to migrate to dialtone 9, first remove the separate dialtone packages:

```shell
npm uninstall @dialpad/dialtone-vue @dialpad/dialtone-icons @dialpad/dialtone @dialpad/eslint-plugin-dialtone
```

*This will uninstall all the existent separate dialtone packages that are included on the mono-package.*

Next, install the `@dialpad/dialtone@next` package

```shell
npm install @dialpad/dialtone@next
```

Once it is installed, replace the paths of the old packages imports with the updated paths, e.g:

Replace

```less
@import (inline) '@dialpad/dialtone-tokens/dist/css/variables-light.css';
```

With

```less
@import (inline) '@dialpad/dialtone/dist/tokens/css/variables-light.css';
```

Please refer to [Import packages](../../../../../../README.md#import-packages) for reference on how to import
each library.
