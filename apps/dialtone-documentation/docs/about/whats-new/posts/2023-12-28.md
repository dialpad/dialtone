Hi everyone, hope you're having a great holidays. As the year comes to an end, it's time for a big update!.
In this blog post we'll talk about the release of Dialtone 9.

## TLDR; Dialtone 9 released and published with @next tag

We decided to release a mono-package containing all dialtone packages under the name of `@dialpad/dialtone`.

This aligns better with our monorepo approach, helps up to ease the task of maintaining all our packages up-to-date
on clients using dialtone and makes using multiple dialtone packages easier.

In order to do so, we increased the major version of `@dialpad/dialtone` as this is a breaking change but released to
@next tag to avoid unintentionally updating clients to this version of dialtone yet.

Also, we're going to continue releasing Dialtone CSS library to `@dialpad/dialtone-css` (formerly dialtone) as a
separate
package in case someone still needs to use it.

### How do I update to Dialtone 9

If you have any of these packages installed, they will need to be uninstalled before proceeding:

- @dialpad/dialtone-icons
- @dialpad/dialtone-tokens
- @dialpad/dialtone-vue
- @dialpad/dialtone
- @dialpad/eslint-plugin-dialtone

Next, install the `@dialpad/dialtone@next` package

```shell
npm install @dialpad/dialtone@next
```

Once it is installed, replace the paths of the old packages imports with the updated paths, e.g:

Replace

```less
@import (inline) '@dialpad/dialtone-tokens/dist/css/variables-light.css';
```

With

```less
@import (inline) '@dialpad/dialtone/dist/tokens/css/variables-light.css';
```

Please refer to [Import packages](../../../../../../README.md#import-packages) for reference on how to import
each library.

Thanks for your cooperation and assistance in improving Dialtone!
