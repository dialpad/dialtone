# Hi Dialers ðŸ’œ

We have a pretty short announcement, but packed with great news! ðŸ¥³

## Dialtone documentation

We are currently on an effort to unify our two documentation sites [Dialtone vue - Storybook](https://dialtone.dialpad.com/vue) and [Dialtone](https://dialtone.dialpad.com) into [Dialtone](https://dialtone.dialpad.com) only.

Today, we are happy to announce the availability of **Vue component examples** on the documentation site. This makes it easier for you to understand the usage, slots, props, events, see some examples and copy the code directly so you can start using our components right away!

We are continuously working on making Dialtone better, so your days working with Dialtone are more enjoyable and hassle free.

If you have any doubt, comment or suggestion, don't hesitate to get in contact with us through our multiple communication channels.

- #dialtone channel on Dialpad.
- Replying to this email.
- [Making a request](https://dialpad.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?issuetype=10975&pid=12508) directly on our Jira project.

Thanks everyone and have a great day!
Dialtone Team ðŸ’œ
