## Introduction

Typography is more than just selecting fonts; it's about creating a harmonious and effective reading experience. In this documentation, we'll explore how our chosen typefaces, styles, and layouts come together to convey a consistent brand identity across digital interfaces.

## Core Principles

Understanding the fundamentals is key. Learn about the anatomy of type, the interplay of typefaces, and how to strike the right balance between readability and aesthetics. Discover how size, spacing, and hierarchy contribute to a seamless user experience.

## Typeface selection

To define the Typeface selection, we make accessibility a priority, so we approach it by using the default system fonts by each operating system to have the best conversion to all possible variables of our product (Japanese, Russian, etc)
