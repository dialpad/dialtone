## Choosing between Dialpad logo color options

<!-- This is temporary, and should be replaced in a more visual nature — possibly as part of the would-be Brand section. -->

Logos are available in a fixed set of color options to suit different backgrounds, contexts, and theme needs.

### Wordmark with full-color logomark

* `dialpad-logo`: Suitable for most cases. Wordmark foreground color responds to Dialtone light and dark themes. For example, the wordmark will be dark in the default theme, and light in the dark theme.
* `dialpad-logo-inverted`: Appropriate for use on a contrasting surface color. For example, in a light theme the wordmark will be light on a dark contrasting surface.
* `dialpad-logo-black`: When the wordmark must remain black regardless of theme or context.
* `dialpad-logo-white`: When the wordmark must remain white regardless of theme or context.

### Monocrome wordmark and logomark

* `dialpad-mono`: Single-color wordmark and logomark in Dialtone's primary foreground color. Responds to Dialtone light and dark themes.
* `dialpad-mono-inverted`: Appropriate for use on a contrasting surface color. For example, in a light theme it would be light on a dark contrasting surface.
* `dialpad-mono-black`: When the entire logo must remain black regardless of theme.
* `dialpad-mono-white`: When the entire logo must remain white regardless of theme.

### Wordmark-only

* `dialpad-wordmark`: Foreground color responds to Dialtone light and dark themes. For example, the wordmark will be dark in the default theme, and light in the dark theme.
* `dialpad-wordmark-inverted`: Appropriate for use on a contrasting surface color. For example, in a light theme the wordmark will be light on a dark contrasting surface.
* `dialpad-wordmark-black`: When the wordmark must remain black regardless of theme or context.
* `dialpad-wordmark-white`: When the wordmark must remain white regardless of theme or context.
