<!--
  NOTE: Comment out since this page isn't just about Illustrations.
  NOTE: We may need to rethink mixing illustations with log assets. We're already thinking of a "Brand" section where logos (and other branding assets) would live. This works for now.
  "Illustrations are the slightly grown up version of icons with a little more detail. A illustration is an image that typically works in tandem with inline text to communicate a state in a more friendly way. They’re most often used in empty states, onboarding, and in-product announcements."

## Brand Logos

<dt-notice
  kind="info"
  title="Dialpad logomark"
  hideClose="true"
  class="d-wmx100p"
>
  <template #default>
    If you're looking for just the Dialpad logomark (the "Ai" shape), you can find them as an icon in <router-link class="d-link d-link--muted" to="/design/icons/?search=dialpad-ai">Dialtone's Icon library</router-link>
  </template>
</dt-notice>

<icons illustration kind="brand-logos" size="large"></icons>

## Choosing between Dialpad logo color options

<!-- This is temporary, and should be replaced in a more visual nature — possibly as part of the would-be Brand section. -->

Logos are available in a fixed set of color options to suit different backgrounds, contexts, and theme needs.

### Wordmark with full-color logomark

* `dialpad-logo`: Suitable for most cases. Wordmark foreground color responds to Dialtone light and dark themes. For example, the wordmark will be dark in the default theme, and light in the dark theme.
* `dialpad-logo-inverted`: Appropriate for use on a contrasting surface color. For example, in a light theme the wordmark will be light on a dark contrasting surface.
* `dialpad-logo-black`: When the wordmark must remain black regardless of theme or context.
* `dialpad-logo-white`: When the wordmark must remain white regardless of theme or context.

### Monocrome wordmark and logomark

* `dialpad-mono`: Single-color wordmark and logomark in Dialtone's primary foreground color. Responds to Dialtone light and dark themes.
* `dialpad-mono-inverted`: Appropriate for use on a contrasting surface color. For example, in a light theme it would be light on a dark contrasting surface.
* `dialpad-mono-black`: When the entire logo must remain black regardless of theme.
* `dialpad-mono-white`: When the entire logo must remain white regardless of theme.

### Workmark-only

* `dialpad-workmark`: Foreground color responds to Dialtone light and dark themes. For example, the wordmark will be dark in the default theme, and light in the dark theme.
* `dialpad-workmark-inverted`: Appropriate for use on a contrasting surface color. For example, in a light theme the wordmark will be light on a dark contrasting surface.
* `dialpad-workmark-black`: When the wordmark must remain black regardless of theme or context.
* `dialpad-workmark-white`: When the wordmark must remain white regardless of theme or context.
