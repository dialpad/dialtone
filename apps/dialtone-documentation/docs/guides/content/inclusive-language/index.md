Test assumptions or biases by sharing content with a diverse audience. Recruit research participants from a variety of backgrounds and roles.

## Recommended language

### Disable, disabled

Don’t label actions or features using “disable” or “disabled.” This can imply that being disabled is a negative state. Alternatively use terms such as “deactivate”, “inactive”, or “turn off.”

### Just, only, easy, etc.

When writing instructional content, avoid stating a task is easy or quick. If you imply it’s easy for everyone, it can discourage those who might struggle. While they might be okay in the correct context, try to avoid using words such as:

* just
* only
* easy
* simple
* quick

It’s okay to use these words in marketing copy when communicating the value of a product or feature.

## Gender

Gender is an important part of many people’s identity. Stereotypes and assumptions about gender can make their way into product experiences and leave people feeling excluded or misrepresented. When you do talk about gender, be intentional. Only use gendered language if it makes your content more inclusive and accurate.

### Internationalization

Many languages lack ungendered options, like the English “they.” When possible, write in a way that avoids gendered language. For example, use “you” instead of a third person pronoun. You may need to work with a translator to avoid unintentionally gendering concepts. Always choose the clearest option.

### Personal pronouns

Dialpad offers users the ability to self-identify their personal pronouns. Use this feature to personalize your copy. Always use their preferred pronouns. If you’re not sure or the user hasn’t set their preferred pronouns, use the pronouns “they/them.” This keeps the content inclusive, simple, and readable.
