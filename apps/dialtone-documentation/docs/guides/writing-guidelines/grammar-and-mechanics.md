## Active voice

We help users accomplish tasks every day. To reflect that acitvity, we write using an active voice in our copy. Use this voice for when the user needs to do something. We only allow a passive voice in very specific scenarios. Otherwise, use an active voice in all copy you write.

To write in an active voice, you place the subject at the start of a sentence. It clearly identifies who is performing the action. This results in more direct and concise writing. It should be clear that the subject is the one doing the action.

> Subject (Person / Thing) + Verb (the action) + Object (What receives the action)

<section class="d-d-grid d-gg16 d-g-cols2">
  <aside class="d-card">
    <h1 class="d-headline--md d-fc-success">Do</h1>
    <p>Calls will be sent to voicemail.</p>
  </aside>
  <aside class="d-card">
    <h1 class="d-headline--md d-fc-critical">Don't</h1>
    <p>Missed calls were sent to voicemail.</p>
  </aside>
</section>

## Passive voice

Try to catch if you're using a passive voice by looking out for the following signs:

* When the object becomes the subject (“the call was made by the admin”)
* Using past tense verbs (“was called”, “was messaged”)
* Using “to be” verbs (“was”, “is”, “were”)

There are times when passive voice is permissible:

* To avoid referring to yourself or Dialpad
* To make it clear that you didn’t personally take an action or make a decision
* If the object is more important than the subject
