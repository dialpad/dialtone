## Active voice

We help users accomplish tasks every day. To reflect that acitvity, we write using an active voice in our copy. Use this voice for when the user needs to do something. We only allow a passive voice in very specific scenarios. Otherwise, use an active voice in all copy you write.

To write in an active voice, you place the subject at the start of a sentence. It clearly identifies who is performing the action. This results in more direct and concise writing. It should be clear that the subject is the one doing the action.

> Subject (Person / Thing) + Verb (the action) + Object (What receives the action)

<section class="d-d-grid d-gg16 d-g-cols2">
  <aside class="d-card">
    <h1 class="d-headline--md d-fc-success">Do</h1>
    <p>Calls will be sent to voicemail.</p>
  </aside>
  <aside class="d-card">
    <h1 class="d-headline--md d-fc-critical">Don't</h1>
    <p>Missed calls were sent to voicemail.</p>
  </aside>
</section>

## Passive voice

Try to catch if you're using a passive voice by looking out for the following signs:

* When the object becomes the subject (“the call was made by the admin”)
* Using past tense verbs (“was called”, “was messaged”)
* Using “to be” verbs (“was”, “is”, “were”)

There are times when passive voice is permissible:

* To avoid referring to yourself or Dialpad
* To make it clear that you didn’t personally take an action or make a decision
* If the object is more important than the subject

## Sentence versus title casing

Dialpad uses sentence casing for all writing except action-oriented areas (e.g., menus, buttons, links). In those situations, we use title casing.

Sentence casing aligns with our more casual brand language. There are times though when being too casual can get in the way. Wayfinding and actions are key moments within Dialpad where it’s important to be more straight-forward and formal.

When writing in sentence casing, capitalize the first word of the sentence and proper nouns only. For title casing, use the following rules:

* The first word of a title or heading, even if it’s a minor word such as “The” or “A”
* The first word after a color, em dash, or end punctuation in a heading
* Major words, including the second part of hyphenated major words (e.g., “Self-Report”, not “Self-report”)
* Words of four letters or more (e.g., “With”, “Between”, “From”)
* Lowercase only minor words that are three letters or fewer in a title or heading (except in rules outlined above):
  * Short conjunctions (e.g., “and”, “as”, “but”, “for”, “if”, “so”)
  * Articles (“a”, “an”, “the”)
  * Short prepositions (e.g., “as”, “at”, “for”, “in”, “off”, “of”, “on”, “to”)
