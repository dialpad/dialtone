# Component Unit Tests

## How do we write unit tests

We use the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) unit testing framework and [@vue/test-utils](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/)
to test our components.

## Where to add unit tests

Unit tests in the `Dialtone Vue` project are written in the component sub directory with the following naming
structure `<COMPONENT_NAME>.test.js`. If a test requires a [fixture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_fixture),
then it is added to the `tests/fixtures` directory.

## What should be tested

### Logic

#### Data

We should ensure that the data layer of our components is tested.

##### Props

We should assert that the props are correctly used within the component. This can include displaying the correct variant
when a given set of props are provided or presenting the user with a given message.

#### Interactivity

##### Reactivity

Ensure that the component correctly updates when there is an interaction. It is recommended that we test the output of
the component rather than the component's data.

###### Example

```js
describe('MyComponent Tests', () => {
  let wrapper;
  let button;

  const propsData = {
    some: 'prop',
  };

  beforeEach(() => {
    wrapper = shallowMount(MyComponent, { propsData });
    button = wrapper.find('[data-qa="button"]');
  });

  it('Updates the button text', () => {
    button.trigger('click');

    expect(button.text()).toBe('Button text');
  });
});
```

##### Events

We also need to validate that the correct custom events are being emitted from our component when we interact with it.

###### Example

```js
describe('MyComponent Tests', () => {
  let wrapper;

  const propsData = {
    some: 'prop',
  };

  beforeEach(() => {
    wrapper = shallowMount(MyComponent, { propsData });
  });

  it('Emits myCustomEvent', () => {
    wrapper.vm.$emit('myCustomEvent');

    expect(wrapper.emitted().myCustomEvent.length).toBe(1);
  });
});
```

#### Accessibility

##### Focus Management

We should assert that any manually controlled focus is correctly managed.

###### Example

If the component moves focus when a menu is opened, we should assert that the focus has moved onto the correct element
within the menu.

```js
describe('MyComponent Tests', () => {
  let wrapper;
  let button;

  const propsData = {
    some: 'prop',
  };

  beforeEach(() => {
    wrapper = shallowMount(MyComponent, {
      propsData,
      attachTo: document.body,
    });
    button = wrapper.find('[data-qa="button"]');
  });

  it('Moves focus onto first dropdown menu item', () => {
    button.trigger('click');

    const firstMenuItem = wrapper.find('#first-menu-item-id');
    expect(document.activeElement).toBe(firstMenuItem.element);
  });
});
```

##### ARIA Roles, States and Properties

We should assert that the correct ARIA states, roles and properties are set within our component.

##### Text Alternatives

We should test text alternatives to ensure that visual elements in our component also have descriptive text alternatives
for screen readers.

###### Example

```js
describe('MyComponent Tests', () => {
  let wrapper;
  let img;

  const propsData = {
    some: 'prop',
  };

  beforeEach(() => {
    wrapper = shallowMount(MyComponent, { propsData });
    img = wrapper.find('[data-qa="img"]');
  });

  it('Has an appropriate alt attribute', () => {
    assert.strictEqual(img.attributes('alt'), 'Some description of the image');
    expect(img.attributes('alt')).toBe('Some description of the image');
  });
});
```

##### Announcements

We should also test that the correct announcements are present when interacting with the component. These are crucial in
providing information to visually impaired users.

### Presentation

#### Snapshot Testing

`TODO: Pending Future Discussion`

## Best Practices

### Test Descriptions

Each `describe` should inform us on either what is being tested or the current state of the environment. Each `it`
should describe what we are validating.

#### Example

```js
describe('My Component Tests', () => {
  describe('When some description of the current environment', () => {
    it('Some expectation that we have asserted', () => {});
  });
});
```

### Single Assertions

We should aim to have a single assertion for each test. There are cases when we will have to use multiple assertions for
a test, these cases should be considered to be exceptions to the guideline.

<h4 style={{ color: 'blue' }}>Acceptable</h4>

```js
it('1 equals 1 and 2 equals 2', () => {
  expect(1).toBe(1);
  expect(2).toBe(2);
});
```

<h4 style={{ color: 'green' }}>Preferred</h4>

```js
it('1 equals 1', () => {
  expect(1).toBe(1);
});

it('2 equals 2', () => {
  expect(2).toBe(2);
});
```

### DRY

We should ensure that repeated assertions are moved into a shared example in order to reduce repeated code. Shared
examples should have the following naming structure `itBehavesLike<SOME EXPECTATION>`. If an example can be shared
across test files then we can add it to the following directory `tests/shared_examples`.

<h4 style={{ color: 'red' }}>Bad</h4>

```js
describe('My Tests', () => {
  let num;

  describe('When num is 1', () => {
    num = 1;

    it('equals itself', () => {
      expect(num).toBe(num);
    });
  });

  describe('When num is 2', () => {
    num = 2;

    it('equals itself', () => {
      expect(num).toBe(num);
    });
  });
});
```

<h4 style={{ color: 'green' }}>Good</h4>

#### Closure Example

```js
const itBehavesLikeEqualsItself = (num) => {
  it('equals itself', () => {
    expect(num).toBe(num);
  });
};

describe('My Tests', () => {
  let num;

  describe('When num is 1', () => {
    num = 1;

    itBehavesLikeEqualsItself(num);
  });

  describe('When num is 2', () => {
    num = 2;

    itBehavesLikeEqualsItself(num);
  });
});
```

#### One By One Example

```js
const itBehavesLikeEquals = (num) => ({
  itself: expectation => {
    expect(num).toBe(expectation);
  },
});

describe('My Tests', () => {
  let num;

  describe('When num is 1', () => {
    num = 1;

    it('equals itself', () => {
      itBehavesLikeEquals(num).itself(num);
    });
  });

  describe('When num is 2', () => {
    num = 2;

    it('equals itself', () => {
      itBehavesLikeEquals(num).itself(num);
    });
  });
});
```

### Test Isolation

We should ensure that tests are run in isolation. Ensure that if we modify the test environment, that it is restored
after the test(s) are complete. Test(s) should pass no matter which order they are executed in.

#### Setup

We can make use of `beforeEach` and `before / beforeAll` to set up our tests.

#### Teardown

We can make use of `afterEach` and `after / afterAll` to restore the test environment to its original state.
