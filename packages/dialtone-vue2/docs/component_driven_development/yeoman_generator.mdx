# Dialtone Vue Yeoman Generator

## Usage

We can use the Dialtone Vue [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) Generator to initialize a new component within the Dialtone Vue
project.

```bash
# From Dialtone Vue root directory
npm run install:all
npx yo dialtone-vue
```

After running the command above you will be prompted for the name of the new component that you would like to create. It
is recommended that the name has the following format `DtMyComponent`.

The generator will then display all of the files that have been initialized.

## Maintenance

### Updating The Generator

Update(s) to the generator can be applied within the following file `generator-dialtone-vue/generators/app/index.js`.

### Creating / Updating Template(s)

The templates used by the generator are located in the following directory `generator-dialtone-vue/generators/app/templates`.
These templates are written in [Embedded JavaScript](https://ejs.co/) `.ejs`.

#### Variables

Variables can be added to these templates using the following format `<%= myVariableName %>`. In order to use the
variable it will have to be defined in the generator `generator-dialtone-vue/generators/app/index.js`.

#### Documentation
