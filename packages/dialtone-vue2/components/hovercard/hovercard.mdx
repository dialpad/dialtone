# Hovercard

<Subtitle>
  The Hovercard component provides a popover-like experience for displaying additional information.
</Subtitle>

## Base Style

The hovercard will appear upon the mouse entering the anchor, with a delay of 300 milliseconds.
It will remain open as long as the mouse cursor is over either the open card or the anchor.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={HovercardStories.Default} />
</Canvas>

## When there are many hovercards

Initially, there is a 300ms delay when numerous hovercards are present.
However, when transitioning from one anchor to another, the delay is determined by the mouse movement time.
This implies that the closer the anchors are, the faster the hovercard appears.
Move the mouse over the avatars to reveal the hovercards in the example.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={HovercardStories.Many} />
