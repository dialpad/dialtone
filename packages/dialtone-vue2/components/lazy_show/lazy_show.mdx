# Lazy Show

<Subtitle>
  Lazy Show is an utility component that prevents its children from being rendered until the first time it is shown.
</Subtitle>

## Basic Usage

`DtLazyShow` is essentially a combination of a `v-if` and `v-show`. This means that the child slot will not be
rendered/initialized until the first time `show` is `true`, after which the slot will stay in the DOM and be
hidden/shown with the `v-show` directive. This is useful to prevent elements which are hidden from being rendered
immediately, but keeping them alive when toggled later.

The lazy show wraps the slot in a parent `div` in order to achieve this. It also wraps the `v-show` in a `transition`,
so you can pass any valid Vue `transition` class to control the enter/leave transitions.

### Import

```jsx
import { DtLazyShow } from '@dialpad/dialtone-vue';
```

```html
<dt-lazy-show
  :transition="transition"
  :show="open"
>
  I'm Lazy!
</dt-lazy-show>
```

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LazyShowStories.Default} />
</Canvas>
