# Rich Text Editor

<Subtitle>
  A rich text editor is a component that allows users to format text with a
  variety of styles. It enables also mixing text with custom components built as
  extensions, such as links and user mentions.
</Subtitle>

<div class="d-notice d-notice--info d-wmx100p">
<b>NOTICE:</b> This component is not a part of Dialtone-Vue core package and can
only be used by other Dialtone components. To keep this code out of the
Dialtone-vue core any Dialtone component that uses this should be built into
their separate build targets.
</div>

## Base Style

The editor itself is without any styling and the intention is to wrap it with
another component, such as Message Input, that provides the UI.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={RichTextEditorStories.Default} />
