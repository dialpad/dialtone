# Dialtone Icons

This is the home for Dialtone icons. It includes the resources needed to implement icons on your application that conform to Dialpadâ€™s design principles and best practices.

## Install Dialtone icons via NPM

To add Dialtone icons into your project, you can install it via NPM:

```shell
npm install --save @dialpad/dialtone-icons

Once installed, you can import icons in a couple different ways:

### In Vue.js

- Individually (preferred):

```js
// named import
import { DtIconAccessibility } from '@dialpad/dialtone-icons';
// default import
import DtIconAccessibility from '@dialpad/dialtone-icons/Accessibility.vue';
```

- All the icon components:

```js
import icons from '@dialpad/dialtone-icons';
```

### In other framework (backbone, jQuery, vanilla)

```js
import DtIconAccessibility from '@dialpad/dialtone-icons/svg/accessibility.svg';
```
